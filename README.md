# My Busman's Holiday - Baselining IoT

Slides and talk from Bsides Splunk 2022

Busman's Holiday is a holiday where one does for leisure what one usually does for a living.  The Busman (the driver) goes on holiday by taking a bus.

This talk focuses on how I baseline IoT devices on my home network; starting with how I inventory what's on the network, then how I base line those items found.  Finally, how to get a free Splunk license for home use.
